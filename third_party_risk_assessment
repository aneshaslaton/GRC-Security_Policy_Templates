## Third-Party Security Risk Assessment Template

This template is designed to assist in evaluating the security posture of a third-party vendor or supplier for your organization.

**I. Introduction**

**Assessment Purpose**
[Briefly outline the purpose of the assessment (e.g., evaluate security practices of a potential cloud storage provider).]
**Assessment Scope**
[Define the scope of the assessment (e.g., focus on data security controls, including all third-party sub-processors).]
**Assessment Date**
[Record the date the assessment is conducted.]

**II. Third-Party Information**

**Vendor Name**
Name of the third-party vendor being assessed.
**Industry**
Industry sector the vendor operates in.
**Services Provided**
Specific services or products the vendor provides to your organization.
**Data Sharing**
Identify what type of data is shared with the vendor (e.g., customer data, financial data, intellectual property).

**III. Risk Identification**

**Threat Analysis**
Identify potential threats associated with the third-party relationship (e.g., data breaches, malware attacks, service disruptions). 
**Vulnerability Assessment**
Evaluate potential vulnerabilities within the vendor's security controls (e.g., weak access controls, and insecure infrastructure).
**Impact Assessment**
Assess the potential impact of a security incident involving the third party (e.g., financial losses, reputational damage, regulatory non-compliance).

**IV. Security Controls Assessment**

**Security Policies and Procedures** 
    * Does the vendor have documented information security policies (e.g., data security policy, access control policy)? 
    * Are the policies relevant to the services provided and aligned with industry standards?
**Access Controls** 
    * How does the vendor control access to systems and data? 
    * Are strong access controls (e.g., multi-factor authentication, least privilege) implemented?
**Data Security** 
    * How does the vendor secure data at rest and in transit (e.g., encryption)? 
    * Are there procedures for data deletion and disposal?
**Incident Response** 
    * Does the vendor have a documented incident response plan? 
    * How will the vendor communicate security incidents to your organization?
**Patch Management** 
    * Does the vendor have a process for patching vulnerabilities in their systems and software?
**Risk Management**   
    * Does the vendor have a documented risk management framework? 
    * How does the vendor identify, assess, and mitigate security risks?

**V. Assessment Methodology**

**Information Gathering Methods**
Describe the methods used to gather information about the vendor's security posture (e.g., security questionnaires, vendor security reports, on-site visits).

**VI. Risk Rating*** 

* Based on the identified threats, vulnerabilities, and security controls, assign a risk rating to the third-party relationship (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

**VII. Remediation Plan**

* If vulnerabilities or deficiencies are identified, develop a remediation plan outlining corrective actions and timelines for the vendor.

**VIII. Conclusion**

* Summarize the key findings of the assessment and the overall security risk associated with the third party.
* Provide recommendations for ongoing monitoring and risk management of the third-party relationship.


**IX. Appendix**

* Include any relevant supporting documents such as the security questionnaire provided to the vendor or detailed vulnerability reports.

**NOTE:** This template is a starting point and is not intended to be comprehensive. This template should be customized to fit the goals, structure, and needs of your organization.
